# Forecasting the outflow of users of a telecom company
> The analysis of data on user behavior by indirect signs is one of the most popular technologies today, not only for business, but also for government agencies. It will allow you to determine the services in demand by the user, as well as help in the implementation of a personalized unique approach to the needs of citizens.

Development of a model for predicting the outflow of users using data about them, based on information about user requests to other sites in the industry and the history of requests to the company.

## General Information
- Task: will the client leave for a competitor
- The purpose of the project: using the available small amount of data to create new features, identify patterns and build a machine learning model to predict the future status of the client - whether he will cease to be a client of the company or not.
- Solving the problem will optimize business processes, determine patterns of client behavior and find growth points, taking into account the model's predictions about the future state of the client



## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 1.3.5
- CatBoost - version 1.0.6
- Numpy - version 1.21.6
- Sklearn - version 1.0.2
- Matplotlib - version 3.2.2


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement
Competitions are held with time restrictions. the presented solution was made within the available time.  Not all conceived ideas have been implemented.

To do:
- Testing the model on new features (visiting competitors' websites)
- Building a model on 50 competitor sites and 50 popular support calls
